Description: X11 Athena Widget library
 libXaw7 provides the second version of Xaw, the Athena Widgets toolkit,
 which is largely used by legacy X applications.  This version is the
 most common version, as version 6 is considered deprecated, and version
 8, which adds Xprint support, is unsupported and not widely used.
 In general, use of a more modern toolkit such as GTK+ is recommended.
